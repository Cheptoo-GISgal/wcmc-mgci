MGCI QGIS workflow
==================
Definition 
----------

The Mountain Green Cover Index (MGCI) is designed to measure the extent and the changes of green vegetation in mountain areas - i.e. forest, shrubs, trees, pastureland, cropland, etc. â€“ to monitor progress towards the mountain target. MGCI is defined as the percentage of green cover over the total surface of the mountain region of a given country and for a given reporting year. The index aims to monitor the evolution of the green cover and thus assess the status of conservation of mountain ecosystems.
